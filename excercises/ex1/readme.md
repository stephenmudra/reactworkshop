Put the title into a H1 tag and say hello to everyone listed in the NAMES array (Can use DIVs or a List)

JSX is a strict XML based language, almost all HTML5 elements are supported. 

Javascript array's have a map function (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) which allow you to return a manipulated object.
